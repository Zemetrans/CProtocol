Compatibility
-------------
Version 16.04:
* ECDHE_PSK authentication mechanism has been marked deprecated. Use ECDHE_SPEKE
  or some other authentication mechanism instead of ECDHE_PSK (ASACORE-2055)
* Some of the qcc::String methods have been marked deprecated (ASACORE-2274)
* Apps calling AllJoynShutdown before waiting for all Standard Core Threads to
  finish execution will trigger a failed assertion on Debug builds and possibly
  an application crash on Release builds. Applications should use
  BusAttachment::Join() to wait for threads to finish execution (ASACORE-2811)
* Security 2.0 methods BusAttachment::AddApplicationStateRule and
  BusAttachment::RemoveApplicationStateRule were not needed so they have been
  removed (ASACORE-2683)
* qcc::GetGid() and qcc::GetUid() return hard-coded, constant values on Windows,
  regardless of the current user's name and domain. This behavior is new for
  Windows domain users. Non-domain users were already getting hard-coded IDs in
  the 15.09 release (ASACORE-2854)
* The incorrect definition of snprintf for Windows has been removed
  (ASACORE-2891). Applications should either:
  - Use the Visual Studio 2015 CRT, that provides a correct snprintf
    implementation, or
  - When using an older version of the Visual Studio CRT, call _snprintf then
    add a zero character string terminator if _snprintf returns a negative value
